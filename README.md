# Marvel Beyond the Multiverse

## Description

This website was built to be able to search for Marvel comics by character, title, or creator, and then determine if there is a corresponding Marvel movie associated with any of the comics that were found. When you search for a comic, you will be presented with the cover of the comic and the name of the comic which also doubles as a link to more information on each comic in the search query. Also, you can view the newest comics offered by Marvel or add comics from the search results to your collection. When you find a movie that has been made by Marvel, you will be presented with the movie poster, rating, the year released, the genre, the plot, and the actors that starred in the movie.
